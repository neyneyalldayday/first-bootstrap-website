homework week 2 bootstrap
this is my web site. all the links shoud take you where you want to go.
it should work on moble as well if all goes to plan. i had some trouble
with the margins on the bottom and on the right. once i applied the sticky 
footer some of my borders got cut off. the responsive videos gave me trouble 
for a while too.
UPDATE:
so at the time of making this i had zero coding under by belt so my "portfolio" consissted of jobs and activities i was currently doing.
